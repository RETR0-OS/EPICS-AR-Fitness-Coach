```bash
git pull origin main
```

Make sure you are in the \Frontend\ directory
Then to test, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To push your changes to github first create a branch,
```bash
git checkout -b "branch name"
```
Then, add the Frontend directory
```bash
git add Frontend/
```
Next, commit your changes
```bash
git commit -m "message"
or
git commit
```
Next push your changes
```bash
git push origin main
```
Finally, go on github, go to pull requests, then make a new pull request.
Wait for someone to approve and merge your branch.

Finally, you can delete the branch once your changes are merged.
